			<h2>STORY</h2>

			<a href="assets/img/jordan-wings-0.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/img/jordan-wings-0.png" alt="wings"></a>
			<p>
			The brand Air Jordan began in 1984, during a time when Nike was a struggling shoe company. At that time, Nike was known as a running shoe company and their running shoe phenomenon was slowly dying. Looking for a way to reinvent themselves and appeal to a new segment of the market, Nike turned to an NBA rookie named Michael Jordan.<p>
			<p>
			Michael Jordan was hoping to sign with Adidas or Converse since he always loved Adidas, and Converse were the shoes that he wore as a basketball player in North Carolina. Converse however was not interested since they already had endorsement deals with other NBA players in Larry Bird and Magic Johnson . Adidas was not interested either.</p>
			<p>
			Although agent at the time, David Falk, saw a great opportunity with Nike since Nike was offering to create a brand new line of shoes called Air Jordans, Nike’s offer did not really interest Michael. In fact Michael told his agent that if the deal that Adidas offered was even close to what Nike offered, he’d sign with Adidas instead, however what Adidas offered was nothing near Nike's offer. Eventually after being convinced by his parents and his agent, Michael agreed to sign with Nike to create the worldwide phenomenal iconic brand Air Jordan.

			<h3>LOGOS</h3>
			<p>
			The original Air Jordan logo was sketched out on the spur of the moment by Nike designer Peter Moore, consisting of a basketball with wings spread out on the side and script above the symbol with the name "AIR JORDAN" printed on it.
			</p>
			<a href="assets/img/wings-logo.png" target="blank"><img src="assets/img/wings-logo.png" alt='wings logos'></a>
			<p>
			When Peter Moore resigned from Nike, Tinker Hatfield took over his position as the new designer for Air Jordan and created the "Jumpman" logo. The logo is created from the silhouette of Jordan as he posed for a photoshoot advertising the Air Jordan I sneaker.</p>
